GEE-Testing
Testing Google Earth Engine

Project Overview:

This repository contains automated test suites for the Google Earth Engine (GEE) web interface, specifically focusing on the functionality and usability of the GEE website. The tests are designed to ensure the reliability and efficiency of the web interface, providing a seamless experience for users interacting with the platform.

Technologies Used:

Selenium: For automating web browser interactions, simulating user actions on the GEE website, and verifying the web elements' responses. TestNG: Employed for organizing, managing, and executing test suites. TestNG facilitates grouping of tests, handling dependencies, and parallel execution, enhancing the testing process's efficiency and comprehensiveness. Java: The primary programming language used for scripting the tests, chosen for its compatibility with Selenium and TestNG, and its robustness in handling various testing scenarios. Testing Focus:

The project encompasses 8 test suites, each targeting different aspects of the GEE web interface. Key areas of focus include:

Navigational functionality and link integrity. Responsiveness and interaction of UI elements. Performance testing of web pages and features.
